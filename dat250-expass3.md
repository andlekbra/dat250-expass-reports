# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 3

## Code

Code is [here](https://github.com/andlekbra/dat250-expass3-mongodb)

## Installation

- To be able to work with my code on different computers without installing all dependendcies, I chose to use the official mongodb docker container from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo).
- I also ran my development environment in a vs code devcontainer with mongodb shell installed. The docker files are available in the repo for further details.
- Since the links are pointing to a tutorial for version 5.0. To avoid inconsistencies I used the latest image of mongodb and not version 4.4 as specified in the assignment.
